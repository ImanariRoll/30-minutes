title: Freezing Bike Ride

Short summary today since I'm trying to get to bed a bit earlier.

I woke up very late, made myself some tasty oatmeal, decided to go out on a bike ride. I put down 20 CHF at the crazy municipal bike loan place, helped translate English -> German for a Russian dude trying to get a bike. We biked out together and chatted a bit, cool guy, professional photographer. I added him on Facebook in case I ever visit Moscow.

Biked out on the right side of the lake, it was just stunningly beautiful, check out the trip album. But then the sun went behind a cloud and I started freezing. I made it back to ZÃ¼rich proper with numb hands.

I went grocery shopping in a new place, no crazy new deals but got enough food to last me through the week. When I got back, I snacked hard on some salami and gouda. Then I went to work. I went through some old emails, filled out some of the Microsoft HR form, found out I needed to specify weeks of vacation in advance, emailed some professors I knew about conferences I might want to go to. By then it was getting late; so I hit the kitchen, fried up some meat that was getting past its expiration along with some veggies from the pizza making. This hodgepodge joined up with a touch of cumin, some habaneros, and leftover pizza sauce and mozzarella to make a delicious meal. I chowed it with fresh bread and butter.

The common room was packed with new and old Culmanners; I played some foosball with Alexis and others, pulled out another comeback win with Darya against Alexis and Ricardo. Simon led the room in a shot of Appenzeller; then a bunch of us went out to a bar. This new Chilean guy got really trashed and entertained everybody; I chatted with a shy new Bostonean exchangee. We propped the Chilean dude up the long stairs to Culmann. I hung out a bit in the common room and ate some more of my hodgepodge. Headed up, wrote this log and prepared to crash.
