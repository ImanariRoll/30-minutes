Highlight mode!

Went to the gym, made myself pancakes to use up the maple syrup from Pancake Day.

Recruited Ally and Michele to go see another FCZ soccer game. It was pretty fun--nothing as spectacular as the fireworks as last time, but the chanting and singing was pretty awesome.

Took the long way back and got groceries + ice cream. I heated up my curry and hung with some Asimov. Then started watching a movie with Ally and Michele, but Michele got stressed out about her classes the next day and bailed. Ally and I dished out the ice cream as planned and watched some ridiculous obscene stand-up comedy. It was hilarious.

Somehow throughout the day I could feel the strange limbo I was in wearing on me. I had so little time left in Zurich and yet so few constraints on that time; no logistical details that needed immediate solving (except booking transport and hostel in Milan) and yet the annoying logistical uncertainty of not having my own room and having just run out of laundry powder, shampoo, etc... I forget that with my high risk and novelty appetite I have a side of me that loves the smooth functioning of basic things. As a little kid I used to dream of having my own floss, which my sisters wouldn't always put in the wrong droor

After that, headed up to my (Alexis's) room and started researching the Italian train system. It took a little while for me to get a handle on what was going on and realize that I needed to be an Italian resident to get their version of the Halbtax card. But I eventually figured it out and made a tentative plan for leaving on Tuesday. Then I crashed out on Alexis' floor. It was surprisingly uncomfortable ;)
