title: Whooee! What a trip

Well, today it was a wild day /
As crazy as they come /
From Zurich by bus to Frankfurt /
And then on to Reyjavik /

Let's see, how did it all begin; it was a simple Sunday /
I woke up late, lunched and read /
Worked on QI, played some hoops /
After that, back to Culmann, worked some more /
Simon was making fondue and hired me for the HB to go /
To buy some bread /

Then we dined on rich cheese /
Clotted in tangles around cubes of bread /
After dinner Janna's man from the States showed up, a mathematical man /
But I couldn't talk for I had to clean /
Simmered in my inability to avoid the taking /
Of tasks the Swiss think need doing /

<!-- Then I crushed some yokels at foosball /
Went out clubbing with a gaggle of Eastern European gals /
The music was loud and the lights were bright /
I lasted about two hours, and summarily retired. -->

Then I crushed some yokels at foosball /
And went upstairs to clean the bathroom, sad saga /
But then I was borrowing a suitcase from Clarissa /
(Couldn't get mine back from Ruth) /
And I was out on the road /
The air was clear and fresh /

Finally I was on the bus /
Met a couple playing chess on the tray tables /
Read my RandAlg for a tad then joined them in conversation /
They got off in Freiburg some 1.5 hours hence /

I calculated I had to sleep on the plane to avoid jet lag /
Kept up on the bus reading *On the Road* and giggling /
drawing the attention of some lovely old ladies across from me /
And the border guards /

Finally slept for a couple of hours /
Missed the alarm I set but thankfully the commotion woke me at the airport stop /
It was 6am in Frankfurt /

I had 5 hours to kill /
Hit a cute grocery in the terminal /
Everything was Germany-cheap /
Got a banana and a yogurt for total 50 Euro cents /
A hot coffee for E1 and a couple Ritter bars for the folks /

Then I made it to Terminal 2 /
Chilled a couple hours in Mickey-D's /
With an egg and bacon McMuffin /
And my banana and yogurt /

Finally, got past security trivially /
Tho' my too too honest self lost my toothpaste at the portal /

Settled down with randAlg in the soul-crushing blandness of the beyond /
Markov chains and mixing times made up for the acres of tile and black leather /
There was also a smoking lounge "A story in every Camel" /

I got myself a Zimt Wuffi /
just as I had arriving in Frankfurt the first time /
A light sweet cinnamon pastry tasting of hope /

Found the gate, boarded /
Finished my chapter of *On the Road* and crashed /
4 hours to Reyjavik /
Woke up in time to see the frozen country /
Brutal and alien, but bright and beautiful from above /

We were late to Reyjavik, a frantic rush ensued /
Got into the line for LAX without a second for food /
Met some contract nurses on vacation /
Their lives sounded pretty neat /
Stresses of contract work to be sure /
But they could live and learn most anywhere in the US /

Swapped my aisle for its adjoint in the middle /
Space to spare /
Slept, then read /
Slept, then read /
Ate my salty peanuts and salami /
Drank down my last swaller of good European Wasser /

Wrote this log listening to some soft sweet music /
I'd heard traveling to Whitman two summers ago /
On the road /
