Today was a happy Friday.

I played hoops, then made brunch with Alexis. We made some absolutely delicious eggs and potatoes and bacon, then tried to make bananas foster on top of pancakes. The sauce separated :P. The pancakes were perfect, though.

Worked on QI for a while. Then it was time to meet Muriel and her friends at the station. We were going to Electro Swing, so I prudently walked to the CAB and bought 2 beers (1, less my free beer). Then I made myself a plate of spicy sausage, for long-lasting sustenance, and quickly chowed them while draining the beer. Felt like an anime character.

Walked down to the station in a great mood. Waited Muriel et al. under the big clock. We walked around a bit for Muriel to grab a bite, then headed to dance. The Alte Kaserne wasn't open yet (some Swiss establishment)
