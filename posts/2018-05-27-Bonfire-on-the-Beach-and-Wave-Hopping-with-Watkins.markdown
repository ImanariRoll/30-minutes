title: Bonfire on the Beach and Wave-Hopping with Watkins

Well we woke up not so bright and early
The hotel breakfast for to take
And headed to the pool
After some crazy UFC fight

Brandon and I chucked the rock
And philosophized in the hot tub
When we were rudely dereverized
Our stay was up earlier than we'd thought

We hustled and packed
And set off for the Astoria column!
It was a fine beautiful day on that hill so high
