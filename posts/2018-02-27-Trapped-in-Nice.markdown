title: The Path of Nietzche, Not a Metaphor

Maddie and I went out for a really good breakfast. I had French toast and a very tasty crepe with salted caramel.

Then we went our separate ways--she wanted to explore Nice and I wanted to hit up a hike in Eze, a nearby town. I soon found out this hike was called "Nietzche's Footpath" and was mentioned in that great philosopher's writings.

So I took the train to Eze, hopped out. Weather was still pretty bad but the bay was clear of fog. I didn't have to go very far up (hike was from the train station on the sea (Gare Eze-Sur-Mer) to the village up in the hills) before the view was pretty amazing. The water was startlingly light blue in some regions.

I walked and thought--thinking in Nietzche's footsteps was pretty inspiring. Climbed some rocks about halfway up--easy to climb, but hard to climb really carefully, so that every move gives you no chance of falling. I climbed in this manner for a bit, then continued on the hike. The temperature was falling and at some point snow lay on the ground, but I continued defiantly in my T-shirt and bright yellow construction gloves. When I got up to the village, I got some looks. It was pretty hilarious. A couple people asked me in French if I was cold :D The village itself was really beautiful, a little medieval maze--I walked around for a bit then finally put my coats on and chowed on a banana, apple, and the last of my Swiss nuts and raisins.

Ran down the path, jumping from rock to rock--it was great. Hopped the train back to Eze and chatted with a French high schooler. Popped back to the hostel.

Maddie was going to the Carnival, which looked not as cool as the one I went to in Lucerne and more touristy. Still, I went out to get dinner with her. Our personality differences showed though. I think we were both expecting the other to make a decision about where to eat and finally, after she dissed both my navigation skills and my indecisiveness, I went back to the hostel in a tiff and microwaved some eggs and bacon I'd bought before I realized there was no stove. Took a bunch of defiant selfies. Chowed the food, played chess, read Pearl's *Heuristics*, had myself a good ol' time.
