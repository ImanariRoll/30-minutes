title: Quiescence

Woke up at 10:30, light streamed under the curtains /
Got up and took a shower, ran over to Migros /
Got some bananas and a bottle of milk /
Broke the fast with a bowl of cereal /

Worked on internship applications for the next couple of hours /
The stress I felt was inexplicable /
I took half an hour's nap /
Discovered the emotion behind a new principle /

There is a warmth in trusting to the present (and one's alarm) /
Perhaps it is only the absence of cognitive dissonance /
The strain of the optimizer that has been with me so long /
But it is in the characterization of its opposite /
That this strain might be released /
I found the dichotomy everywhere for the rest of the day /
Between the warmth of simple belonging /
And the sullen grittiness of tirelessly pondering change /
Viewed in this light, the anxieties of social positioning /
Are just another facet of the abandonment of quiescence /

LEEEEEROY....
(ahaha, not so quiescent yet!)
After the nap I felt like dancing,
found a tango lesson and booked it to HÃ¶nggerberg /
On the way, I read Pearl's Heuristics text /
Met some cool people, I'll go back next week /
Then I went back, hit up the Migros again for some hackfleisch /
Overpriced tortillas even couldn't faze me /

I went to the Polyterrasse gym to hoop it up, got into a good game /
Lots of fun /
Back home to make some tacos /
Hung out with Alice and her buddies /
Then it was late /
Wrote this blog and crashed!
