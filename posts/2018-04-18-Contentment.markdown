Woke up late, irritating! Must try to plan sleep schedule more carefully.

First part of day homework. Finished physics homework but was challenging. I needed to pull out scratch paper, with scratch worked much more effectively and had more fun. Had a great lunch of last bit of lasagna, cucumber salad and sourdough bread.

After day of working, went to Unit Disc game. Peter there, but no game. Off day today. Peter and I joined another team, the Biology Darwinners, and lost barely. Frisbee is an interesting game because you can only contribute so much if you're really full of energy and having an on day (especially if the team is relatively new) unlike basketball, where you can do much more. I thought I made a lot of good plays but we still couldn't pull off the win. Great game!

Went to the gym, did a few of the high-weight pull-downs I used to do in Switzerland, took a shower, and went to Swing team food! It was at Chili's. Had a good time yakking with Preston and good food. I was very content.

Went back to Stevens; on the way ran into Winnie. She decided to study with us. So we started working in M. Winnie showed me more hilarious Kant quotes, and we talked a little bit about her research; she showed me some plots. I got to show her the genome analysis I've been thinking so much about lately, and in analogy with some of the Kant quotes, I brought out my "The Phenomenon of Life" Christopher Alexander book (which is much better and clearer IMHO, but has the same kind of mystical vibes, as some of the Kantian metaphysics). Trevor jumped into the conversation a bit, which was fun. We also did some goofing off with Winnie's weird pencils and my fedora and the fan--at one point we were both singing into the fan and listening for echos of some kind. There was also a hilarious moment where Winnie brought up a google doc with some serious Physics Department official writing, from a committee she was on--I jokingly made to edit the doc and Winnie quickly pulled her laptop away--no goofing off on recorded version history! I nearly died. I was in such a good mood, I solved the error dependency problem I'd been working on in CompBio (I think). Winnie left after we figured out logistics for the next day--(quick dinner at the 8 then play then bubble tea, let's go!) and then I had a fun conversation with Trevor.

Soooo... I guess I needed that extra sleep this morning after all! I gotta wake up at 9 tomorrow, no compromises :D

Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose! Goodnight :D
