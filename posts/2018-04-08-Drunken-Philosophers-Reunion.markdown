Terrific day! Woke up late, breakfast and readings. Finished readings, chilled with Max and Alex a bit. Rideshare-biked over to the gym, decided to take a little bike ride along the trail because everything smelled amazing after the rain. Headed back to the gym, got into some good hoops. Got some great rebounds, solid D, played well offensively but missed shots. Aarghh! If I could just consistently make my shots I'd be quite a solid player.

Then it was back to Stevens, worked on my CSE assignment. I decided to copy their setup exactly to avoid any configuration struggles and so far it's going great. Nearly finished.

Went over to D to watch some UFC fights with Brandon et al. The fights went a long time but were really spectacular to watch. The heart and tenacity of the fighters were impressive, and the technical skills were mindblowing. I can only imagine the psychological battles that go along with such a violent game.

We made it for the Drunken Philosophers meeting at Finn's just as stuff was going down. I got to catch up with Caleb, which was great :D :D Had a boatload of good conversation, nachos, and cheap Shock Top pints!

On the way back got into a German conversation with Alex. Wrote this log and hit the hay. Cheerio!
