Got up late this morning, cursing myself for my tardiness. Jet lag still active. But at least I didn't sleep until 7:30pm this time, woot!

Then I was off to the races. I made myself breakfast, read more *Heuristics*. I started writing the cover letters for my Microsoft internship application--this stuff always takes me forever. I plowed through it pretty decently, breaking for a taco at 2:30 or so, then continuing to work until past 5. (I also prepped some other writing samples).

I went to a yoga class at the CAB, which was nice, but harder than I expected because we held some poses for a long time while the instructor gave further instructions in German which I couldn't discern from my fellow students' configurations.

Back home, made myself an omelette-taco. (When all one has is omelettes and tacos, make an omelette-taco to relieve the tedium!) More friendly banter with Culmannites.

Returned to work, churned out more famously slow writing on the cover letters. I got to read a couple papers into the bargain, though--one in particular, by a lead on one of the projects, on adding user defined functions to [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/excel.pdf?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fusers%2Fsimonpj%2Fpapers%2Fexcel%2Fexcel.pdf), was really neat!

Made myself some tea, read Brandon's blog, and hit the hay!
