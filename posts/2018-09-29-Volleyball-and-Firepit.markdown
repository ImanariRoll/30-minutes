title: Volleyball and Firepit

Worked on GRE in the morning. Made the second of two paired daggers to take to Boston to spar Winnie ;)

Went to class, Cobden went quickly through E&M review, lots of stuff to mull over. Met Joseph for lunch at Rancho Bravo. Quite tasty! Seems like he's doing well, still in Haggett, which is cool. Hanging out with his squad. We went to play badminton after, ended up playing tennis because they were out of badminton rackets. Had a good time sweating in the hot sun. One of Joseph's buds, Matthew, joined us for a bit; then I had to run. Showered, threw my glee stuff on, and got to Hec Ed just in time. We were singing the national anthem at a volleyball game against Colorado. We sang really well, had the breaths down right--maybe just new year energy! but people were high fiving us and congratulating us--one old lady said it was beautiful :)

Went to watch the game, only 1 glee dude with me. Made friends with a freshman gal next to me who'd come by herself. It was an exciting match! UW finally dominated in the 4th and deciding game.

Headed back to Laurelhurst, made myself some tacos. Fielder argued that starting a fire in our newly acquired firepit would not be so easy--the wood was wet, and we needed kindling. I found wood that had been under a tarp and Brandon shaved the kindling. The screws on the firepit legs were loose, as Amazon reviewers had warned, and some had fallen off into the box; but I quickly figured out what was going on, found the screws, and we were in business.

The fire was a roaring success. Got to hear a little more of Wyatt's background and got into some fun debates about free speech and online dating (via Wyatt). We took some time off occasionally to bench press with Brandon's new equipment :D and even goofed off with the two dagger boffers a bit.

I brought out the s'mores stuff-Brandon had a few and I think I had 3. Nom!

Finally, we cleaned up. Brandon played a bit of Halo and I played some blitz chess, pretty successfully despite a bit of alc-induced mental lag; then wrote this log and hit the hay.
