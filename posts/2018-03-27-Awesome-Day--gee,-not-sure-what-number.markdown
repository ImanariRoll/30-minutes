Today was an excellent day.

I woke up, made myself breakfast, did a little research on this goofy scholarship I might apply for, then hauled to Comp Bio capstone. There I was greeted by Aishu and Katharine! After class, which seemed promising, I got lunch with Aishu at the Sizzle and Crunch. It looks like the 3 of us may form a project team :)

Went to Community Music--that was awesome! The professor was absolutely hilarious--a Puerto Rican not-quite *abuelita*. She played us some music clips and stood there quietly singing along ;) She introduced herself with some shaggy-dog stories about playing music in Spain--she seemed completely guileless and happy. Then she went around and welcomed each of us to the class. I had got into a little pickle introducing myself earlier and responded with good humor, and when she got around to me, she was like, "You have a beautiful aura!" How cute! The class looks great too. She played us some amazing fandango clips from a Seattle based organization that we might go visit. And I guess now I have lots of reading to do...

Then I met Joseph for badminton. We played a pretty epic game after lots of warm up--he beat me 21-16. Gotta step up my game!

Back home for a shower, then Glee! I came in 30 minutes late because the schedule had forever said 5:30 when it should be 6. This time it was right. I got a rousing cheer of sorts when I walked in in my fedora ;) Two new TAs, they seem alright :D

Home again, did some work. I did the first 331 homework, which looked like it should be really easy, but actually wasn't. It was an algorithms proof. Either I missed some easy way to do it, or good luck to everybody else! It took me 45 minutes to see that the reason I couldn't prove my first algorithm worked was because it didn't ;) After that, made myself a delicious scramble.

Watched half an episode of Mad Men and played a couple games of live chess. Alex and Max came over to hang out and we chatted and watched a video on piano tuning. Wrote this log and went to bed, too late again :P
