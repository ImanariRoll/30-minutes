Woke up late :) Janna made some lentil soup for everyone because she was leaving, so I joined a number of Culmanners at the repast.

Then, I went to go get a wheel of raclette to bring back for Christmas, as per the McLeod Institute's request. I hiked down into the city, which was posh and beautifully decorated and alien; found the giant Migros City embedded deep in a shopping mall. I found what I was looking for, but decided to double-check prices at Coop. Went to Coop, they didn't have any wheels. I also had to make a dish for a Christmas party I'd been invited to that evening at Sara's apartment. I wanted to make a quiche and so I got myself some Gruyere. But after a lot of indecision, I saved myself from the folly of trying to make a fancy quiche and decided to make potato gratin; picked up the remaining ingredients and the raclette wheel at Migros City and walked home.

Dropped my hoard in the fridge and went to play basketball. I struggled initially then went into confident mode and started destroying.

Headed back and started on the gratin. It took me a while to get all these silly little raclette potatoes peeled but then we were in business. After a brief stint in a pan with cream and nutmeg and garlic, the potatoes went into the oven, and I went upstairs to watch Mad Men. Fortunately decided to check early, micromanaged just enough, to come out with a delicious looking gratin.

Popped it in a bag and bussed over to Sara's! I was just in time. I greeted Jenny and Sara and Erik and Mihaela with enthusiasm. Mihaela had to go right away (darn, just missed her last time too). But the party was in full swing (to the oscillation limit of refined dinner parties). Sara was directing the baking of vast quantities of delicious little cardamom cookies. Met some new people (Katerina, Nina, Francesco) and we all sat down to eat. It was delicious and I was having a blast. Gideon from my RIAI class showed up; his crafted, System 2 conversation formed a foil for my quick, System 1 unleashed banter. We learned about a tradition in Sweden where every Christmas Eve the entire country watches the same Donald Duck rerun (legendary!) as well as a plethora of delightful little traditions that Jenny's family honors in the UK. Had a lot of fun talking with Jenny :)

We broke out some glug, a Swedish version of gl√ºhwein, and then started goofing around with a guitar that was lying on the couch. Erik and Sara were off in their own bubble singing what sounded like Swedish campfire songs. Jenny and Francesco passed the guitar back and forth as we tried to find songs to sing. We got through "House of the Rising Sun" :D :D. Jenny tried to teach us a few new songs and then we went for "Hallelujah".

Then it was time to pack up. Lots of hugs and Merry Christmases :) I *barely* caught the last bus in the Culmann direction, along with Gideon; and walked the rest of the way home.
