Well, today was another cracker of a day /
Work on interview problems in the morn /
Hoops for the second day in a row /
Got socked in the eye with an elbow /
But finished with some great drives /

Barely finished in time to make egg salad /
For a potluck dinner party for my friend's birthday /
Whom I'd met on the challenge run /
And helped with a Swedish Dance workshop /

The party was amazing /
We sat civilized, tucking into terrific food /
I met a man named Axel, from Sweden /
Who was bicycling to Morocco and beyond /
Into the heart of Africa /

He was a water engineer /
Just out of school /
A mad cat /
He'd interned at a Palestinian engineering firm /
Crossing the border into Israel every morn /

We talked about water and politics /
About border crossings and adventure /

Then I talked excitedly with my pal Cameron /
A machine learning master's student /
A man of excellence and true inspiration /
He told me he skipped lectures and learned /
Only from the problem sets /
But not just their solutions /
Nay, he learned more from imagining /
Why one would have written each problem /
And soaking in the context of his discipline /

We spoke of new kinds of convnets /
And masters young and old /
Of competition, which fired Cameron's ambition /
I brought up Waitzkin and the notion of a metric eternalism /
I must have mentioned ten different books, from Waitzkin to Meaningness/
In the conversations that evening /
The fellows looked at me surprised /

At last I headed out for Alice's birthday in Culmann /
Met Michaela coming in on the way out /
Terrible timing! /

Further I missed the bus, the stop was confusing /
Sprinted after it for two more stops but couldn't make it /
I replotted and arrived at Culmann not long after /

Joined the Culmanners for the end of a hearty dinner /
Beer and wine /
Played some foosball and conversed /
As the party madly continued at Culmann /
Went out clubbing with a gaggle of Eastern European gals /
The music was loud and the lights were bright /
I lasted about two hours, and summarily retired.
