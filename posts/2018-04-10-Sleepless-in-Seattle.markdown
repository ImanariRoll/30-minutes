Woke up bright and early after my late night conversation with Trevor, showered and chowed and shook the bleariness off, and headed straight to CSE. CompBio was fun--described to the team my new scheme for generating documentation and asked Ruzzo a bunch of questions. Went straight to physics, pretty fast paced lecture, then off to music. My example of [free play in music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I_NYya-WWg), which I'd dredged up from a goofy night with some physicists, went over really well :D I also got to talk with the prof about how you build community with music and got some ideas about my birthday party :P

Amazed that I'd held up so well on 5 hours of sleep, I got myself a delicious teriyaki lunch and people-watched on the Ave while I ate it. I met up with Katherine to work on understanding another part of our project; on the way I stopped by Rancho Bravo and got us two tasty horchatas :D

Wanted to take a nap but no time; went straight to Glee. There I was really flagging. Had to get back afterwards for lasagna, and THEN off to basketball with my buddy Luke. We had some pretty intense games. My legs are super sore writing this. I got back, tried and failed to help Meera to fix a broken Python environment, did some admin work, and collapsed.
