A quiet Friday! Lots of work at home. In the evening, I went and played 2x2 volleyball (or "beach" volleyball, without the beach.)

When I got back, nobody was going out from Culmann, but everyone was having a good time regardless. We played a lot of foosball, and then Anna and Erika and I watched Little Miss Sunshine (I love that movie!!).
