Worked most of the day to get my resume updated and completely reformatted (having given up on the fruitless digital-resume making). Went to Quantum Info., chatted with Coraline a bit after, then parked myself on a table and went to work writing cover letters. After language class, back at Culmann, kept up the same good stuff. At the end of the day, I'd applied to most of the places I'd seen earlier, including a position for being a trader at an investment firm, and an engineering position at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle.
