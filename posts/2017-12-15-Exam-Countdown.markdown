Morning: quiet breakfast, read RandAlg and wrote up notes.

Afternoon: basketball, big lunch, read more RandAlg.

Evening: realized that Sara was teaching another Swedish dancing workshop! Went to that, read RandAlg on the bus. It was really fun, Jenna was there (we'd gotten there early and demonstrated last time we were both there).

Home, worked a bit more, made a tasty dinner. Wrote up my last little note summary, decided to go to bed early. Took a walk, then crashed.
