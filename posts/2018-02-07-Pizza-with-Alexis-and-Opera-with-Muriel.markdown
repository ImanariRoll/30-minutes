Pizza part TBA

I was squeezing in some work after an absolutely lovely run on my usual route to the viewpoint near the Irchel campus and got a message from Muriel--she was arriving in the HB in 20 minutes or so, and I could hop on her train to get to the opera. I quickly switched to my khakis that I'd folded sideways to simulate a pleat--it had worked! and put on Alexis's suit over my humdrum gray button-down. I debated whether to go tie or no tie. I thought, this tie with that button-down--this is the kind of thing a goofball like me would do, that nobody with *actual* class would attempt ;) But I went and tried it on anyway, and it worked great. So little of the button down was showing under the suit and tie that it faded into the background, as intended--and that suit was dashing!

I ran down to the train station and hopped onto the train. Some technical glitch caused a little stop and some hilarious WhatsApp banter--Muriel tried to simulate sci-fi English :D

We poured off with hundreds of other people at the Stadelhofen station and found each other in the subterranean walkways beneath. Muriel was dressed in her elegant white jacket. We walked in the direction of the opera house, onto the great square of smooth grey tiles before it. It was a lovely place, even in the near-darkness obscuring the river. And the opera house was very majestic. Muriel left her jacket in the garderobe upon request (how they knew it was outerwear and not a new style of formal dress was beyond me) revealing an equally elegant costume. (For some reason we didn't take any pictures, crying emoji) We found the ticket counter and got in line for student tickets. Muriel was stressing about her student card (her dog literally ate it)--she'd brought an official document of enrollment instead. After some hemming and hawing, the fellow accepted the document and we got two tickets on the balcony.

I offered my arm and we swept up the red carpeted stairs to the third floor and found our booth. We had the front row all to ourselves, which was lovely.

To be continued!
