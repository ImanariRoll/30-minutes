Woke bright and early, went to CSE lecture. Had a nice 10min conversation with Akshay, had a cool idea for the nonprofit he worked for. Apparently, corrupt officials in India often ask for bribes when they actually can't carry out their threats, but people are still worried about getting evicted from their dwellings. So why not price the risk with eviction insurance?

Spent a couple of hours outside sending email, researching backpacks (I concluded the one I have is the best, it just needs some repair), and reading my new Effective Java book, which was very interesting. It was really nice outside!

Back to Mercer, had a really tasty lunch, read some [Meaningness articles](https://meaningness.com/fluidity-desiderata)

Went to CSE to meet my Capstone team; on the way picked up my *Nature of Order* book that I'm finally going to finish reading :D Meeting went great, we were productive. Went to the gym afterward, then researched how to automate viewing abstracted versions of our source files with annotations, found a good tool and a good way to use it :)

Went back to Stevens to make lasagna! I was in a bit of a hurry because of swing, so it was a little stressful, but I came out with two full pans of lasagna. One was entirely eaten by the Stevens crew and Katherine from CompBio who I'd invited over since she lived really nearby. We had fun discussing aerodynamics of frisbees--I think Katherine really liked our goofy group :D

Off to Swing! I finally ended up dancing the whole time rather than spending time in conversations, since there were some noobs there I had fun teaching. Ended up dancing a lot with one of them, a PhD student in public health named Mina. I love dancing with noobs! Suddenly it's all about learning again. Another guy named Joe wanted to brush up on his swing outs and we practiced together a lot because I wanted to learn how to follow. I could hardly believe it was 11:30 when it was and we all had to head out.

Back at Stevens, got into a late night conversation with Trevor that went quite a while. We realized we saw a lot of social interactions in the same light--it was just how we dealt with what we both saw that was different.

I realized then I had to still write my annotations for a music reading, did that, played a few chess puzzles on the way, wrote this log, and... damn it's late! Good night y'all!
