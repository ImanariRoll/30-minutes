title: Martin's Guitar Bar

Today was a Tuesday! Which meant I had RIAI! I excitedly hustled over, only to find that we were reviewing the basics of neural networks. #sad

Afterwards though I went with Martin and got lunch, which was fun. He told me about his past life as a demolitions worker (after he graduated with his math degree and didn't know what to do). He said the work was fun, but so exhausting that he literally couldn't do anything physical outside the job and had to recuperate all weekend. We also talked about possible ways to efficiently represent a Tetris gamestate (Martin was thinking about making a tetris-playing AI).

Went to Randomized Algorithms, answered a question there eloquently :) And then off to RIAI exercises, which weren't worth their salt this week, because review. Martin invited me to see him and his girlfriend play in a bar (after his demolition work he spent a while just traveling and playing guitar), free entrance! I decided to go.

Just did work most of the rest of the day, then went to the bar! It was really fun. I got there a few songs before Martin and Kristin were up; the band that was there was really cool, playing mostly American songs, rock and folk. Met Carlo, Martin's cool mathematician roommate, and we talked about nested graphs.

Martin and Kristin were really good! They played Swedish folk songs mostly. Kristin had a beautiful high voice and Martin was killing some bizarre riffs. At one point they played "I See Fire", and the beginning riff, if you know it, the complicated one, Martin plucked on the guitar.

After they played (the band took a long break and they went off repertoire and still did great) we got beers and chilled for a while. Then I hoofed it back to Culmann.
