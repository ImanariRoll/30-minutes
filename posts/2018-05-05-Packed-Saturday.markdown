Blog is back for a quick recap /
then I gotta hit the sack /

Went for dim sum in the morn
With Winnie I rode down to Chinatown
We ate many delicious things
From braised rib to turnip cake

The canoe rental was closed
Cuz Windermere Cup took all the rows
So we swung by home for a Rick and Morty
Then to physics my gal I ported

Back at home I smiled /
not yet tired /
Turned out we were getting house keys today /
I biked to Laurelhurst our new digs to survey /

They really did look pretty sweet /
A full garage and the garden was neat /
I pored over every room with joy and pride /
Like the Forsbergs' the place had rhyme /
in every piece of trim and wallpaper slip /

We talked a bit about how to split the rent /
I might be willing to pay extra for the big sunny hardwood floor /

Then I hit the gym /
But on the way there /
A rando hailed me kicking a soccer ball /
So we played some games of one on one /
Two goals were set out in the golden sun /
We had lots of fun /
Then I went to play my hoops /
Found my old buddy Luke /
We lit up the shiny maple boards /
I got lots of flying...
BOARDS
and we rolled over skilled hooplords /

Hair filled with sweat and filled with smiles /
I walked back in a warm light drizzle /
But who should run past me on the road /
But Titus, good man, a Gleester old /
So I hastened up to match his stride /
Heard his refreshing political tides /
I ran with him all the way to Gasworks /
Jumped off at Stevens / man my legs hurt /

Winnie came over fresh after my shower /
I ate a grilled sandwich for a good half an hour /
Then we had to go buy toilet paper /
Even though I'd brought over two rolls just earlier not later /
Arggh just get out of your bed and do it yourself /
Complaining roommates--but hey free rent is the best /
So we went over to the DM and bought some rolls /
I pitched them at Meera quoting Caesarian tax law /

We settled down then to some more Rick and Morty /
That show is so funny I can't even ignore it /
When Winnie is snuggled up tight next to me /
We had some great fun, I and she /

Aaaah, what an evening! I walked Winnie back /
Did some chess puzzles and wrote up this textual snack /
I think maybe soon I'll do a recap /
First I caught up on sleep, next I'll bloggy attack /

Goodnight yokels / from near and far /
Some of you I'm missing / Some are right here /
I bid you adieu, yes I bid you sleep well /
Hope to see you in life before I see you in ... /
;) :D
