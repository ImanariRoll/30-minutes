Phenomena

I get along really well with people when I first meet them. It takes effort but it's a lot of fun. I mostly ask them questions about themselves and chat about side things that come up.

But then after I talk with someone for a while... I'm not one to chatter on endlessly and *make* conversation. There are only a few people I can talk with for long periods of time. Most of them are fives, and we talk about things I actually consider interesting. E.G. Dad, Grace, Brandon...

Whether Muriel is one of these people I'm not sure. She is not really similar to Grace.

The class of people I enjoy meeting with for lunch once a week or every two weeks might be a lot bigger.

And my inner optimizer might be involved saying that if I'm making conversation then there's something better I could be doing with my time.

Another phenomenon by which people wear on me might be related to my face blindness. E.G. I forget which things we've talked about, so I get nervous. This last problem can clearly be solved by remembering things about people and bringing them up, so as to build off prior encounters. And this in turn works better if I meet with said people regularly. Otherwise I forget.

This gets very confusing. The phenomena I have for sure are

that I usually enjoy meeting new people (especially when there is *opportunity* to do things with them).

I don't like the stress of having to make conversation and strongly prefer situations where conversations flow naturally.

This is people.

With pursuits, we have the following related phenomena:

that I usually enjoy learning a new thing (especially when there is opportunity to apply it).

I learn better if I do the thing regularly (2-3 times a week seems ideal .

If I lose interest in the thing, (and/or) I stop doing it as regularly, then it feels like more effort when I come back to it; it feels stressful, like I have to make something happen.
