Damn. Things picked up fast!

Today has been the beginning of another wild week, selling donuts for the SPS with Winnie, launching into a literature review for Comp Bio, catching up on 226 and saying hi to ol' Prof Garcia with homework due Thursday!

I went to a big block of classes in the morning, read papers with the Comp Bio crew, caught up on old special relativity material in 226, had a blast bringing up "development recapitulates phylogeny" from Elly's high school biology class in Music, of all places.

Got back to the apartment, did some more lit review and finished the CS homework. Off to Glee, had some fun, felt my voice getting back in shape. Then to Safeway to get some groceries and most importantly, taco supplies, and mostest importantly, some beer! I took my gains to D and started cooking. Jacob and Brandon and Alex got in on the taco fest. Jacob brought a friend from his salsa class and was dancing for "homework". Afterwards, we cleaned the kitchen to some rousing rap from mostly me and Jacob.

Brandon had picked up my amazon packages so I brought them back to M and put up my tension rod and hung up my clothes! I have a really nice place now. After that was done, hung out with Trev and Casey a bit, played a tad bit of live chess, and hit the hay.
