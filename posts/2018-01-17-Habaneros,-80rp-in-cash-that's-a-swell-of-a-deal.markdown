Woke up 15 minutes earlier than yesterday again! I like this incremental approach :D

Quiet morning, worked on quantum.

Went to Hongg for basketball, played a lot of 1-on-1, which was really fun. I love 1-on-1!

Back again to the house, quick omelet, then to Aldi's. It was snowing today, cold and wintry, but the sun came out in time for my walk. Before I got to Aldi's I hit an Indian food store--my diet had been feeling a bit bland so I wanted to add variety. I got some lentils and spices, some roti, some coconut milk, and most importantly, a bag of habaneros. They were beautiful little things, swirled in green and gold and crimson red.

Aldi's I went nuts, got myself a ton of things. I got lots of fresh veggies and fruits, some tasty looking bread and salami, frozen pizza, cereal, milk and yogurt, chocolate, odds and ends like pasta sauce and mayonnaise--the total came to CHF 45. Nom.

It was a long walk up the hill with my two bulging grocery sacks and backpack full of Indian food, but I made it. After a lengthy unpacking and organizing session, I went back to the quantum.

I was getting frustrated, but pushed through it into a zone of surprising productivity. I wrote down important takeaways and kept the right balance between actually doing calculations, revising my approach against the solution's approach, and deriving fundamentals. I got in nearly 3 hours then went down to make some curry.

I chopped and loaded up my skillet with first veggies, then meat, then spices in oil, and finally the coconut milk. I tasted a habanero sliver and it was really spicy, so I only put in half of a habanero. I cooked some instant rice I'd been hoarding and fried up a roti. Dang, that was good. Talked to Giacomo a bit while eating it, sweat pouring down my face--he actually asked me whether I'd been to the gym beforehand. I kept adding a bit more habanero until the entire thing was gone, and washed the curry down with a glass of milk. I still have another serving!

Did laundry, listened to some upbeat songs on "Longest Time" radio on Spotify, went back to quantum for a bit, was tired, of course then tried to play some bullet chess (wow, that was a smart way to rest your analytical capabilities Past Spencer). Got destroyed. So I wrote this log. Cheerio!
