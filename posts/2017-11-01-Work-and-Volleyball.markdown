Not so much happened today! I didn't see Coraline at QI, so after class, I went to the outdoor climbing wall and goofed around a bit on the wall and slackline (I don't know if I've mentioned this, but it's awesome!)

After that, it was mainly work until I went to another beach volleyball session; met a cool guy there (by both doing unnecessarily many pushups doing the warmup). Played a few fun games! Serves and smashes were pretty decent :D
