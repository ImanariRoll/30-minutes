title: Another Hop Across the Pond
author: Spencer
---

Well, it was 6am in Frankfurt Flug /
Blearily I rode into town with a two wheeled mule /
To see a sunrise of coffee in a cheap supermarket /

Camped at a high McDonald's peak /
Victuals of yogurt and sweet PB&J /
Rustled a rogue Game Theory problem /
Met a Guatemalan shepherdess who watched my wooly bags /

Submitted my cattle /
The price was better for sides than for head, too big /
So I butchered and packed on the spot /

Then the dusty trail beckoned /
Fought my way through the border, contraband toothpaste in hand /

To a delayed flight I flew /
Met a kindergarden teacher in a one room school /
We chewed the fat as we waited for stragglers /
A few youngins danced and wiggled their tongues at me /
So I played with them on an imaginary railway /
They were as goofy and bright as cactus flowers /

Finally, we were aboard and underway /
I knew not whether I'd catch the 3:10 to Chicago /
But read still in peaceful serenity /
Of greater adventurers yet than yours truly /

On the ice-swept plains of Rekjyavik /
I was bold enough to fill my canteen /
And still catch that connecting train /
With the help of some kind freight-hoppers /
Who watched my bags at the station door /

On that train now these letters I scratch /
Clutching in my knees my dusty cowboy hat /
I'll see you soon, Mom and Pop and sisters and cousins /
In those sweet old pastures we've wintered aplenty seasons /
Yea, I'll find you by your grins on the old snowy asphalt /

*Chorus:*
