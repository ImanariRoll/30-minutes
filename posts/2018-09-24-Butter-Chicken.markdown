Sung at convocation today! Goofed off on turf fields with some dudes while we were waiting to sing.

Met Johan for lunch, had really intense lunch as he tried to pitch me on robotics project. What a guy!

Took a bike ride, then exhausted, took a nap. Called Winnie (chatted about Johan and the lunch) then started on a butter chicken adventure! Biked to QFC for coriander, then ground my own garam masala. Spent a while with the Instant Pot just because it was my first time, but got everything cooked. Holy cats, was it good! Spices are everything, I guess.

Hung out with Brandon et al., played a little Uno, fixed some random old Unix stuff, wrote this post such as it is...
