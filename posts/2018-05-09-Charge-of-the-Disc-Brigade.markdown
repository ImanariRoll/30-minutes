Woke up bright and early with a little mental coercion--I'd slept like a log. Made myself a quick breakfast and headed over to the SPS. Picked Winnie a little yellow buttercup. She showed up a few minutes later, just as tired as I was ;) We recruited Devin and hauled our chairs, table and donuts up the long road to Red Square. As usual I felt pretty badass hauling that table up the stairs :D Throwback to hauling OSB sheets ;)

Sales were sluggish and we started out in the shade, which was actually quite freezing--I'd miscalculated and left my jacket at home. Winnie left to meet her lab prof. I folded some paper airplanes and read a little bit of the Descartes book Winie had given me. The puzzle I'd written kept on engaging--I had a lot of fun with it and sucked some more people onto our newsletter email list. T
