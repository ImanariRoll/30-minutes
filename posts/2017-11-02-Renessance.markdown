Highlights:

1. Chatted with my QI professor, one Renes, after class about his research! He was working on quantum error correcting codes, and he said applications were a long way away, although getting closer. He invited me to his group meeting on Monday :)
2. Read a bit of that unpublished review paper that Prof. Fratallocchi had given me at the colloquium a while back.
3. Met my language class buddies to work on a goofy presentation we have to give.
4. Went back home and chilled and worked.
