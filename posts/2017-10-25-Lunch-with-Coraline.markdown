Serious highlight mode now!

Had lunch with a gal from my QI class! It was really fun :D Coraline, from the French part of Switzerland, is a polymath, taking the QI class (a sort of CS/physics/theoretical class) but actually into both EE and materials science, AND working on a thesis project applying machine learning to Internet of Things network traffic, AND trying to understand fluid dynamics in cactus spines. We had a pretty far-ranging conversation.

In the evening, I faced the evils of semester cleaning. We had to clean our little, tiny, perfectly clean bathroom to Intel fab room standards. It was terrible, especially because I used to do that kind of thing voluntarily in my youth and had used up a lifetime supply of energy to be used for pointless cleaning. I barely survived without either drowning myself in Potz sink cleaner or seriously annoying my comrades. But I stayed until the end of it, some 3.5 hours after we started.

AND THEN WE DIDN'T PASS! AAAAARGHGHGH
