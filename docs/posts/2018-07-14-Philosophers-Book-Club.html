        <p>I write this from the steps of the Community Center on 50th, in the stifling heat of a tremendous wave. Little vortices of boiling air drift up from the concrete and casually spur my hands to write.</p>
<p>On the Saturday in question, I woke bright and early (around 9:30!) on the weekend after going to bed around 12. This is a really awesome achievement for me. After a quick call from Winnie about to hit the hay, I busied myself tidying my room, opening Amazon packages, and the like. By the time I was done with tidying and doing a bit of logistics, it was almost noon. I sat down at the piano and played some chords, goofed around a bit. Then I set out on the day’s quest.</p>
<p>A 50-cent ofo took me to the Sizzle and Crunch on the Ave, where I fortified myself with a massive bowl of pork belly, grilled pork, rice and veggies. A second ofo sent me screaming into the strange regimes of Seattle south of Fremont but north of Queen Anne, where a certain used bike shop was said to be found.</p>
<p>Inside, the proprietor was friendly and busy as hell. He kept answering phone calls, bustling around fixing bikes… It looked like a solid place. I described to the dude what I was looking for, a mostly road-oriented hybrid, and he said “I have just the one for you” (not really, but close). Ooh, too real! 300 in cash was a hell of a deal! (Maybe xD) He pointed me to a bike with a grey Cannondale frame. It was light enough I could pick it up on one finger.</p>
<p>I gave it a test ride outside, after the ofo grind I found it quite fine. It was super fast and light and hauled up hills, though it jounced over bumps and had low handlebars / I tested another bike for the comparison, a Raleigh cruiser with a nice orange frame. This bike was comfortable, but the speed difference was apparent–it crawled up hills like a somnambulant ferret / I went to a cafe for a long drink of water / And called Mom to talk the deal over / I figured in the end there was little risk to the deal / I could sell it back for $100 overhead, let’s be real / And I’d spent enough time agonizing.</p>
<p>So I picked up the bike–I couldn’t believe it! The fastest big decision perhaps me’d ever reeled in / And I hauled back to Laurelhurst in 30 minutes flat Parked my Grey Rocket in the garage And rolled off to QFC in Alex’s car</p>
<p>I got pizza fixin’s and a bottle of bourbon Set the yeast abubbling hopefully not a curdlin Took a long cold shower and Skyped Winnie at 6(:55) Then the philosophers rolled into the mix</p>
<p>We chopped up the mushrooms and the serranos as well Fielder made up the sauce and I rolled out the shell While we worked we talked of Venezuela’s big struggle They didn’t have the money to run their own oil hustle</p>
<p>Finally / the pizza ready / settled around the dining table / We started on the topic of Dostoyevsky / And the first existential novel of his we had found / the acclaimed Notes from the Underground /</p>
<p>We skyped in Winnie and turned on the recorder (Brandon wanted to hear how his voice sounded in a later moment) The discussion began with some fascinating passages Read by Eric and Brandon.</p>
<p>The notion that man in a utopia would fall discontent Was a well known theme to us, but still was time well spent I liked the idea that the last descriptor of history was “rational” and that most great leaders lived just to paint their names on the wall Certainly they acted not out of hedonism Though I think many acted out of loyalty to their peoples</p>
<p>The discussion turned inevitably to free will Too general, I thought–these discussions always sway Caleb and Eric went at it Brandon interjecting thoughtfully his way of coping with determinism I started thinking about non-physical models for consciousness And drawing the causal graph for this external state</p>
<p>But soon I found myself very tired And when Caleb and Eric left, after cleanup I swiftly retired I wonder now what’s happening to me A 10-2 man under temporal 9-5 siege :D</p>
