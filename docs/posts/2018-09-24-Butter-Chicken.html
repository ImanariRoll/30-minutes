        <p>Sung at convocation today! Goofed off on turf fields with some dudes while we were waiting to sing.</p>
<p>Met Johan for lunch, had really intense lunch as he tried to pitch me on robotics project. What a guy!</p>
<p>Took a bike ride, then exhausted, took a nap. Called Winnie (chatted about Johan and the lunch) then started on a butter chicken adventure! Biked to QFC for coriander, then ground my own garam masala. Spent a while with the Instant Pot just because it was my first time, but got everything cooked. Holy cats, was it good! Spices are everything, I guess.</p>
<p>Hung out with Brandon et al., played a little Uno, fixed some random old Unix stuff, wrote this post such as it isâ€¦</p>
