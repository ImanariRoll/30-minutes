        <p>Woke up late, took a nice run. Chatted a bit with some of my swing family at the UW after seeing pictures of the quarter dance on the group chat :) Did a little bit of work, had breakfast and tried to explain some quantum information stuff to people downstairs. Then met Joan and Julie for a museum visit!</p>
<p>We went down the stairs from Culmann to the big museum right across from the Hauptbahnhof, which I’d (amazingly) never visited. It was really nifty.</p>

<p>We also tried to decode some beautiful political satire paintings in German, and I got some of the sentences all the way through: Ich weiss jetzt wer meine Freunden sind!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>–Angry Switzerland walking out of an OECD meeting into a room of pirate countries (Cayman Islands, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had a quick lunch at the museum’s bistro, and then I went to basketball. It was fun, I played a lot better than yesterday. Then I went home and wrote this log.</p>
