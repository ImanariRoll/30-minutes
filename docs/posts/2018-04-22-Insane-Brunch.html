        <p>Woke up after staying up really late, just in time to shower before preparing for a mad brunch. Winnie showed up early and helped us clean :)</p>
<p>It took a while for the brunch to get going, but man, it felt so well organized. I don’t know what it was exactly, but we had lots of able hands and everything came together like clockwork. It was probably the classiest brunch we’d had. We had amazing potatoes cooked in bacon grease with onion and garlic and serrano, creamy eggs, fleeky English muffins, crispy chewy bacon, a whole array of delicious hot sauces… not to mention terrific well-spiced thick slabs of French toast with real maple syrum and whipped cream. I supplied most of the ingredients but everyone chipped in :D We sat around eating and talking for a good while. Winnie and I powered through the dishes, then went outside and did reading. We stopped for a frisbee break, then walked over to Physics and had a good deep conversation.</p>
<p>Walked back to Stevens in the glowing sun and made myself a hell of a grilled sandwich. Ate it reading physics. The material was dense, but I Leroy’d through it, then went to take a run. No sooner had I set out than Winnie was calling me from Stevens–she needed to come back in and grab her watch. She hadn’t had dinner so I made her some eggs and she showed me what she’d been doing in the lab. Finished my run, wrote this log, showered off and hit the hay.</p>
