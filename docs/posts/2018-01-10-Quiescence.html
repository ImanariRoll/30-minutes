        <p>Woke up at 10:30, light streamed under the curtains / Got up and took a shower, ran over to Migros / Got some bananas and a bottle of milk / Broke the fast with a bowl of cereal /</p>
<p>Worked on internship applications for the next couple of hours / The stress I felt was inexplicable / I took half an hour’s nap / Discovered the emotion behind a new principle /</p>
<p>There is a warmth in trusting to the present (and one’s alarm) / Perhaps it is only the absence of cognitive dissonance / The strain of the optimizer that has been with me so long / But it is in the characterization of its opposite / That this strain might be released / I found the dichotomy everywhere for the rest of the day / Between the warmth of simple belonging / And the sullen grittiness of tirelessly pondering change / Viewed in this light, the anxieties of social positioning / Are just another facet of the abandonment of quiescence /</p>
<p>LEEEEEROY…. (ahaha, not so quiescent yet!) After the nap I felt like dancing, found a tango lesson and booked it to Hönggerberg / On the way, I read Pearl’s Heuristics text / Met some cool people, I’ll go back next week / Then I went back, hit up the Migros again for some hackfleisch / Overpriced tortillas even couldn’t faze me /</p>
<p>I went to the Polyterrasse gym to hoop it up, got into a good game / Lots of fun / Back home to make some tacos / Hung out with Alice and her buddies / Then it was late / Wrote this blog and crashed!</p>
