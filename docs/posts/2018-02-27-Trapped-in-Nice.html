        <p>Maddie and I went out for a really good breakfast. I had French toast and a very tasty crepe with salted caramel.</p>
<p>Then we went our separate ways–she wanted to explore Nice and I wanted to hit up a hike in Eze, a nearby town. I soon found out this hike was called “Nietzche’s Footpath” and was mentioned in that great philosopher’s writings.</p>
<p>So I took the train to Eze, hopped out. Weather was still pretty bad but the bay was clear of fog. I didn’t have to go very far up (hike was from the train station on the sea (Gare Eze-Sur-Mer) to the village up in the hills) before the view was pretty amazing. The water was startlingly light blue in some regions.</p>
<p>I walked and thought–thinking in Nietzche’s footsteps was pretty inspiring. Climbed some rocks about halfway up–easy to climb, but hard to climb really carefully, so that every move gives you no chance of falling. I climbed in this manner for a bit, then continued on the hike. The temperature was falling and at some point snow lay on the ground, but I continued defiantly in my T-shirt and bright yellow construction gloves. When I got up to the village, I got some looks. It was pretty hilarious. A couple people asked me in French if I was cold :D The village itself was really beautiful, a little medieval maze–I walked around for a bit then finally put my coats on and chowed on a banana, apple, and the last of my Swiss nuts and raisins.</p>
<p>Ran down the path, jumping from rock to rock–it was great. Hopped the train back to Eze and chatted with a French high schooler. Popped back to the hostel.</p>
<p>Maddie was going to the Carnival, which looked not as cool as the one I went to in Lucerne and more touristy. Still, I went out to get dinner with her. Our personality differences showed though. I think we were both expecting the other to make a decision about where to eat and finally, after she dissed both my navigation skills and my indecisiveness, I went back to the hostel in a tiff and microwaved some eggs and bacon I’d bought before I realized there was no stove. Took a bunch of defiant selfies. Chowed the food, played chess, read Pearl’s <em>Heuristics</em>, had myself a good ol’ time.</p>
