        <p>Went to the Lemon Festival and then to Monaco with Maddie from the hostel. It was snowing in the south of France (!?)</p>
<p>Had some delicious baguettes, peeked over the wall at some really cool Bollywood themed lemon sculptures (?!)</p>
<p>In Monaco visited the lobby of the famed Monte Carlo casino. Also a terrific auto museum. Maddie knew a lot about the cars and even about the suspension systems on old carriages, which was interesting.</p>
<p>Hung out at the hostel, felt like I was with the fam trying to decide what to get for dinner. Maddie was dog tired but finally overcame her lethargy and we went to a restaurant. Amazing lamb and potatoes :D But Maddie was (actually, not just jokingly) crushed that they didn’t have any Creme Brulee.</p>
<p>Finished Catcher in the Rye today. What a story. It felt really real and vivid, more like a narratization of the author’s experience than any kind of metaphor. I never realized, “catcher in the rye” doesn’t describe a baseball catcher. It described the only kind of job the tortured protagonist could imagine would actually be real and meaningful. Standing in tall rye grass next to a cliff, catching the kids playing in the field when they were about to fall over the cliff. It’s a beautiful image, one that resonates a lot with my days as a homeschool game organizer :)</p>
<p>Skyped with Grace and called it a night!</p>
