        <p>Today was pretty chill. Woke up around 10:30, worked a bit, hit the gym for some hoops. Then I had lunch with the old Randomized Algorithms crew, which was fun. Aleks might be interested in traveling with me part of the way–it’d be fun to have a buddy and I think he would be perfect, always cheerful but kind of reserved.</p>
<p>Went back to Culmann, found another internship that Ayush had mentioned (OpenAI). They’re a nonprofit doing “fundamentals” research and interested in how artificial general intelligence might arise and what to do to make sure it goes well when it does. I’ll finish that application tomorrow. Then I studied more RIAI, kind of listlessly, chatting with Muriel all the while about our next engagement.</p>
<p>I was just exhausted so I took a 20 minute nap. Then I went down to the kitchen and made myself a tasty omelet. Good chatting with Anna.</p>
<p>Returned to work with substantially more vigor, until Mia et al. invited me to watch a movie with them. We ended up watching an episode of Black Mirror(!), about a weird relationship-choosing system. Definitely interesting and very well acted. They went to watch another episode, but I went, did some laundry, and watched a little Mad Men. Then I wrote this log and hit the hay!</p>
