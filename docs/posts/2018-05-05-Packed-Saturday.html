        <p>Blog is back for a quick recap / then I gotta hit the sack /</p>
<p>Went for dim sum in the morn With Winnie I rode down to Chinatown We ate many delicious things From braised rib to turnip cake</p>
<p>The canoe rental was closed Cuz Windermere Cup took all the rows So we swung by home for a Rick and Morty Then to physics my gal I ported</p>
<p>Back at home I smiled / not yet tired / Turned out we were getting house keys today / I biked to Laurelhurst our new digs to survey /</p>
<p>They really did look pretty sweet / A full garage and the garden was neat / I pored over every room with joy and pride / Like the Forsbergs’ the place had rhyme / in every piece of trim and wallpaper slip /</p>
<p>We talked a bit about how to split the rent / I might be willing to pay extra for the big sunny hardwood floor /</p>
<p>Then I hit the gym / But on the way there / A rando hailed me kicking a soccer ball / So we played some games of one on one / Two goals were set out in the golden sun / We had lots of fun / Then I went to play my hoops / Found my old buddy Luke / We lit up the shiny maple boards / I got lots of flying… BOARDS and we rolled over skilled hooplords /</p>
<p>Hair filled with sweat and filled with smiles / I walked back in a warm light drizzle / But who should run past me on the road / But Titus, good man, a Gleester old / So I hastened up to match his stride / Heard his refreshing political tides / I ran with him all the way to Gasworks / Jumped off at Stevens / man my legs hurt /</p>
<p>Winnie came over fresh after my shower / I ate a grilled sandwich for a good half an hour / Then we had to go buy toilet paper / Even though I’d brought over two rolls just earlier not later / Arggh just get out of your bed and do it yourself / Complaining roommates–but hey free rent is the best / So we went over to the DM and bought some rolls / I pitched them at Meera quoting Caesarian tax law /</p>
<p>We settled down then to some more Rick and Morty / That show is so funny I can’t even ignore it / When Winnie is snuggled up tight next to me / We had some great fun, I and she /</p>
<p>Aaaah, what an evening! I walked Winnie back / Did some chess puzzles and wrote up this textual snack / I think maybe soon I’ll do a recap / First I caught up on sleep, next I’ll bloggy attack /</p>
<p>Goodnight yokels / from near and far / Some of you I’m missing / Some are right here / I bid you adieu, yes I bid you sleep well / Hope to see you in life before I see you in … / ;) :D</p>
