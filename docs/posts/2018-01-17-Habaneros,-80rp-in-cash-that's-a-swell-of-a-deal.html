        <p>Woke up 15 minutes earlier than yesterday again! I like this incremental approach :D</p>
<p>Quiet morning, worked on quantum.</p>
<p>Went to Hongg for basketball, played a lot of 1-on-1, which was really fun. I love 1-on-1!</p>
<p>Back again to the house, quick omelet, then to Aldi’s. It was snowing today, cold and wintry, but the sun came out in time for my walk. Before I got to Aldi’s I hit an Indian food store–my diet had been feeling a bit bland so I wanted to add variety. I got some lentils and spices, some roti, some coconut milk, and most importantly, a bag of habaneros. They were beautiful little things, swirled in green and gold and crimson red.</p>
<p>Aldi’s I went nuts, got myself a ton of things. I got lots of fresh veggies and fruits, some tasty looking bread and salami, frozen pizza, cereal, milk and yogurt, chocolate, odds and ends like pasta sauce and mayonnaise–the total came to CHF 45. Nom.</p>
<p>It was a long walk up the hill with my two bulging grocery sacks and backpack full of Indian food, but I made it. After a lengthy unpacking and organizing session, I went back to the quantum.</p>
<p>I was getting frustrated, but pushed through it into a zone of surprising productivity. I wrote down important takeaways and kept the right balance between actually doing calculations, revising my approach against the solution’s approach, and deriving fundamentals. I got in nearly 3 hours then went down to make some curry.</p>
<p>I chopped and loaded up my skillet with first veggies, then meat, then spices in oil, and finally the coconut milk. I tasted a habanero sliver and it was really spicy, so I only put in half of a habanero. I cooked some instant rice I’d been hoarding and fried up a roti. Dang, that was good. Talked to Giacomo a bit while eating it, sweat pouring down my face–he actually asked me whether I’d been to the gym beforehand. I kept adding a bit more habanero until the entire thing was gone, and washed the curry down with a glass of milk. I still have another serving!</p>
<p>Did laundry, listened to some upbeat songs on “Longest Time” radio on Spotify, went back to quantum for a bit, was tired, of course then tried to play some bullet chess (wow, that was a smart way to rest your analytical capabilities Past Spencer). Got destroyed. So I wrote this log. Cheerio!</p>
