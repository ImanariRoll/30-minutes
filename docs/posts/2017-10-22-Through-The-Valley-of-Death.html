        <p>Warning: This post is on the rapidly decaying tail of the detail distribution (that peaks on the day of writing)</p>
<p>Essentially, fueled by the prospect of applying to interships with a digital resume, I opened up my Haskell site code. I made some beautiful refactorings, which was really fun. Then I decided to separate the repository for my personal website and for this zurich-blog. This would make maintenance easier and also give my personal website the slick domain of spencerpeters.github.io, with no cruft on the end. This, ironically, rendered my beautiful refactorings unnecessary.</p>
<p>Doing this also required descending into the valley of death, mostly with configuring Git to work with Hakyll. If you publish from a straight-up username.github.io site name, you canâ€™t put your site files in a subfolder, which makes using Hakyll tricky. Some Git wizardry is required to automate deployment, which was awful as usual to set up. Then I had to migrate Disqus comments..</p>
<p>At last I was done and then I enjoyed an evening of relaxing in Culmann.</p>
