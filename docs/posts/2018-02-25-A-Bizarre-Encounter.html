<p>Arrived in Nice today with a gal, Morgan, from the hostel in Genoa. She showed me how to get downtown then got back to her studies.</p>
<p>Immediately in the hostel I was accosted by a too-friendly fellow, Ivan. He turned out to come from a very wealthy background and be correspondingly weird in lots of ways–conspicuously, he didn’t have the ability to tell whether you were interested in hearing what he had to say. I reverted to primal-go-with-anything Spencer and actually hung out with the guy for a good while. We went to a restaurant and he ordered 20+ Euros worth of food (I ordered 8). Then he challenged me to Ping-pong and foosball–I squashed him, to his surprise. Next he showed me a pretty interesting card game and beat me soundly at it.</p>
<p>Had dinner at a kebab place with a fellow hosteller, Erica, a traveler from Brazil. She used to be a statistical analyst somewhere but wanted to do something more social. Erica thought young people were rushing into the rat race too quickly and confusing themselves, not really understanding what they were good at, and wanted to write a book/blog/etc. to communicate this, so was just traveling around and learning about herself and others. Seemed really 5-like and genuine. Was interested in homeschooling.</p>
<p>Went back to the room. Skyped the fam. Goofed off and played some chess puzzles. Met a gal named Maddie. Ivan came back around 12:30, walked around in his Georgio Armani underwear, and kept us up with bizarre chatter. I could see Maddie in the lower bunk rolling her eyes at me :P Eventually I told the guy as nicely as I could that I was hitting the sack for real–he finally took the hint–and I crashed.</p>
