        <p>Having spent all of yesterday in a desperate struggle against the Breaking Talent, I now turned my attention to a terrifyingly nasty Randomized Algorithms homework. I’d solved two of the problems, but had two more to solve and I still had to type up the ones I’d solved. That was pretty much the day; in the evening I collaborated a bit with Aleks which was fun. One of the problems I had a totally novel solution to that I thought gave a better bound than I was supposed to give, but the solution was hell to type up. At about 11:55 I submitted the homework, then crashed (after Aleks and I swapped homeworks and examined each other’s solutions.)</p>
