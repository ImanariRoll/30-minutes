        <p>Well, it was 6am in Frankfurt Flug / Blearily I rode into town with a two wheeled mule / To see a sunrise of coffee in a cheap supermarket /</p>
<p>Camped at a high McDonald’s peak / Victuals of yogurt and sweet PB&amp;J / Rustled a rogue Game Theory problem / Met a Guatemalan shepherdess who watched my wooly bags /</p>
<p>Submitted my cattle / The price was better for sides than for head, too big / So I butchered and packed on the spot /</p>
<p>Then the dusty trail beckoned / Fought my way through the border, contraband toothpaste in hand /</p>
<p>To a delayed flight I flew / Met a kindergarden teacher in a one room school / We chewed the fat as we waited for stragglers / A few youngins danced and wiggled their tongues at me / So I played with them on an imaginary railway / They were as goofy and bright as cactus flowers /</p>
<p>Finally, we were aboard and underway / I knew not whether I’d catch the 3:10 to Chicago / But read still in peaceful serenity / Of greater adventurers yet than yours truly /</p>
<p>On the ice-swept plains of Rekjyavik / I was bold enough to fill my canteen / And still catch that connecting train / With the help of some kind freight-hoppers / Who watched my bags at the station door /</p>
<p>On that train now these letters I scratch / Clutching in my knees my dusty cowboy hat / I’ll see you soon, Mom and Pop and sisters and cousins / In those sweet old pastures we’ve wintered aplenty seasons / Yea, I’ll find you by your grins on the old snowy asphalt /</p>
<p><em>Chorus:</em> :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D</p>
