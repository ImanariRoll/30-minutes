        <p>Got a good 10 hours of sleep and woke up at 1pm. (10, rather than 9, because Europe has some weird Daylight-Savings-Time like entity.</p>
<p>Got some breakfast, which was nontrivial because a massive kitchen cleaning was underway. This ancient tradition, dating back to the founding of Culmannstrasse, involves a subset of burghers who work all day, in exchange for pizza and an exemption from kitchen duty for the rest of the semester. I barely talked my way into the kitchen to get my cereal, despite previous guarantees that my box and fridge would remain accessible.</p>
<p>Read my QI lecture notes and refreshed myself on the different types of complex matrices, why unitary matrices represented time-evolution and Hermitian matrices represented measurements, and refreshed myself on the properties of the trace.</p>
<p>Then I took a walk/run up into the forest above my house, and ended by going down the Seilbahn Rigiblick (a funicular), which I hadn’t done before.</p>

<p>After I got back, I heated up some pasta (also a struggle) and kept working. After a while, I walked outside, saw that Betty’s window was open; we waved and I walked back inside to say hi :) To my surprise, she’d walked over and was there when I opened the Culmann door. We took a quick walk through the fog and light rain that ended up on the Polyterrasse terrace looking over the old city. It looked really cool shrouded in fog.</p>
<p>Walked back, kept working, got brain-fried and looked at possible flights back home for Thanksgiving. Eventually, it was time for more food, and I’d agreed with Betty and some others to meet at 7:30. Unfortunately, when we did, the kitchen yokels wouldn’t let us in! They totally threw away their accessibility guarantee. Our kitchen responsible, usually a balanced and friendly individual, reprimanded me “not to keep checking every 5 minutes” even though I’d been studying for 2 hours.</p>
<p>So… went back and Skyped Mom and Dad! A fun Skype, which meandered through sunny woods far from the crags of existentialism.</p>
<p><em>Then</em> finally it was time for dinner! The kitchen cleaners had finished. I pulled out the hamburgers I’d cooked for myself the previous day, along with some mayonnaise and a frosty Chopfab lager, and sat down with Alexei, Betty, Ruth, Oliver, Tom. A good meal! Alexei had his first ever PB&amp;J. Afterwards, played some foosball, then came back up and worked on the log!</p>
