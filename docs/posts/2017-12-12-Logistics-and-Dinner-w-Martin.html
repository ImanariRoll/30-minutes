        <p>Quick highlights today!</p>
<p>Went to RIAI class, was interesting but mostly technical details, nothing too inspiring.</p>
<p>The rest of the morning and into the afternoon was consumed in the logistics of paying for insurance and rent. Blecch. The insurance had to be paid, since I don’t have a Swiss bank account, by filling out all the payment details on little slips of paper before paying with cash at the post office. Maybe there was a better way…</p>
<p>I had a great lunch, realized I forgot my backpack at the post (yikes!) got that. Went to RandAlg exercise class–1 last prep before the exam. Paid rent, got groceries; by the time I got back it was about an hour before Super Kondi and I took a quick nap (~30 min). That was awesome and I made it through Kondi with energy to spare.</p>
<p>After that Martin came over for dinner; we made some really good burgers alongside pasta and salad. Wow! We talked for a while and only had a little chance to analyze the RIAI slides. Then kitchen cleaning.</p>
<p>Oog, I’m really tired :P Night!</p>
