            <h2>Welcome to the 30 Minutes project!</h2>

<p>This is my attempt to bootstrap a real blog (not just a journal).
    My inspiration is the early xkcd <a href="https://xkcd.com/1/">cartoons</a>
    , where it's clear Randall Munroe is just having fun, 
    making doodles and occasionally putting them up online, without worrying too much about the thematic consistency
    evident in his mature posts. In fact, it seems like he is <i>discovering</i> his themes and style as the cartoons progress.
    This is what I want to do--write little pieces of shortform for fun and hopefully discover a theme and style--
    and I'm setting aside 30 minutes a day to do it. Enjoy :) </p>
